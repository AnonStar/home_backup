This is just a simple backup script i wrote together for myself, mainly to learn python.
If I get around to improve it, maybe it will someday be actually useful for some other people except me.
Tested with python2.7 under Arch Linux.

Big Thanks to Colin Stewart who wrote the sync-backup script that's doing the main work. You'll need this one
if you want to use my script.
